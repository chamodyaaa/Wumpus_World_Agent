# 🏹 Wumpus World – Logic-Based Agent with Pygame Visualization

This project implements the **classic Wumpus World problem** from Artificial Intelligence. The main goal is to develop a logic-based agent capable of navigating a dangerous 4x4 world, collecting gold, avoiding pits and the Wumpus, and returning safely to the starting position.

---

## 🔹 Features

- **Logic-based agent** capable of:
  - Moving, turning, grabbing gold, and shooting the Wumpus
  - Deducing safe moves based on percepts (stench, breeze, glitter, bump, scream)
  - Planning the shortest path to the gold and returning safely
- **Pygame visualization** for interactive simulation
- Handles pits, Wumpus, and hazards dynamically
- Demonstrates reasoning using percept-based knowledge

---

## 📌 Objective

The agent must explore the grid, collect the gold while avoiding dangers, and safely return to the starting point. This project combines **AI reasoning** with **visual representation** to illustrate decision-making in uncertain environments.
